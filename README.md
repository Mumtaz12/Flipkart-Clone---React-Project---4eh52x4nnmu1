#Making the Project Flipkart clone using React
##About the Project
The Flipkart clone was developed by me within one week. I have done all the parts of it like designing the page, adding the features and also face so many challenges in doing it, but It was not fully cloned now, I have working on it and making it perfect day by day.

In this article, we will go in-depth and discuss-
How I have made the project?
What are the challenges I have faced throughout the project?
What Tech I have used?
I have developed the project individually within 3 days of time frame where I have cloned the basic design and feature like add to cart. I have faced so many challenges like adding the modals, It was not coming well but I have figured it out and done it at EOD. I have used HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, REACT, and REDUX on making these.

##Key Learnings & Overview of Project-

###Some key learnings are-


Time management: I have managed the time properly and able to design the basic structure and functionality of the website within 3 days, It was come due to the experience of working in more than 7 projects both individually and collaboratively.
Ownership: As I was doing the project on my own I have to make the whole project within three days as I have set the deadline which plays an important role in making the project within time. so, I have taken ownership of the project and seen the design and implemented it, and finally made the project completed within the time.
During the project, I have learned not to stick for too long in a single feature. As It will eat up the time and our project will not have a good number of basic features which can be implemented easily.
